- 👋 Hi, #I’m @nealalex
- 👀 I'm fascinated by the intersection of tech, AI, and why my kids can master a new app in 10 minutes but still can't see socks on the floor
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python by cheating and asking ai to do everything
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on oil and gas projects, especially simulation and vector plotting
- 📫 reach me at neal.alexander@gmail.com
